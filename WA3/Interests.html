    <h2>Interests</h2>
    <p>Beyond my professional experience, my interests and hobbies play a big role in shaping who I am. I’m passionate about fashion, creative projects, and staying active. Over the past three years, I’ve built a CU-themed apparel brand, giving me a creative outlet to merge entrepreneurship and fashion. I also love the outdoors and movement, which is reflected in my work as a soccer coach and my journey toward becoming a competitive boxer. </p>
