    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>I’m Livi Klein, a 20-year-old marketing student at the University of Colorado Boulder, originally from New York City. </p>
    <h2>Interests</h2>
    <p>Beyond my professional experience, my interests and hobbies play a big role in shaping who I am. I’m passionate about fashion, creative projects, and staying active. Over the past three years, I’ve built a CU-themed apparel brand, giving me a creative outlet to merge entrepreneurship and fashion. I also love the outdoors and movement, which is reflected in my work as a soccer coach and my journey toward becoming a competitive boxer.
    <h2>Goals</h2>
    <p>To live a happy and fulfilled life.</p>
